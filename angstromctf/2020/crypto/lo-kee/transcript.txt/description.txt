The evil organizers aplet and kmh are clearly up to something, but they are using the Ko-Lee key exchange! It seems that they are using the Rubik's Cube as their group. The readable part of their conversations is linked [here](transcript.txt).

Help me find the key! (Put the position into the cube solver, and then wrap the scramble without spaces in actf{}. If the outputted scramble was R U R' U', the flag would be actf{RUR'U'}.)
