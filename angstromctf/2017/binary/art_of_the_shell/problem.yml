title: Art of the Shell
value: 80
text: |
  Looks like this program has a buffer overflow vulnerability! But there's no
  code inside that spawns a shell, so it must be secure! Get the flag anyway by
  exploiting it on our shell sever. The problem is available as:
  [binary]({{ art_of_the_shell }}) and [source]({{ art_of_the_shell.c }}).
hint: If the code isn't in the program, better write it yourself.
flag: actf{shouldve_used_the_nx_bit}
files:
  - art_of_the_shell.c
  - art_of_the_shell
deploy:
  type: shell
