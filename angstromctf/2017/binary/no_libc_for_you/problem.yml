title: No libc for You
value: 150
text: |
  Even ASLR and NX can't seem to stop you from exploiting all these buffer
  overflows. Rather than remove the buffer overflows, we decided to use static
  linking so you can't access libc anymore! Can you get the flag with no
  system() to help you out? Go ahead and give it a try on the shell server. The
  problem is available as: [binary]({{ nolibc4u }}) and
  [source]({{ nolibc4u.c }}).
hint: How is file I/O done with static linking?
flag: actf{ya_gotta_luv3_r0p_ch4in5}

  - nolibc4u.c
