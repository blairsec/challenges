  Noah has written a cool new service to help people organize their todo lists!
  Before he releases it to the public, you've been hired to do a pentest of the
  app. Connect to `shell.angstromctf.com:9000` and find the flag he
  placed there! Source code available [here]({{ todo_list.c }}) and binary [here]({{ todo_list }}).
hint: You may find the libc binary on the shell server useful.
flag: actf{oh_crap_we_actually_have_to_pay_you}
