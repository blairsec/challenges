title: Running in Circles
value: 50
text: |
  Our data input program was vulnerable to overflows, so we fixed that by
  implementing a circular buffer. Now it should be totally secure! See if you
  can prove us wrong and get the flag on our shell sever. The problem is
  available as: [binary]({{ run_circles }}) and [source]({{ run_circles.c }}).
hint: Think about all the conditions we might be in when reading data.
