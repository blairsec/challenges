  Defund made his own version of pastebin in a fancy programming language! A
  true believer in open source projects, he uploaded some of his
  [code]({{ nameaccess.ex }}). Retrieve the file `flag` from his pastes. defund
  also included a sample file, `paste.txt`, in the pastes. The service is
  running at `web.angstromctf.com:3001`.
