title: Randomized Cipher
value: 250
text: |
  It appears that the random SP network is back! Same concept as last year with
  slight modifications to make it more interesting. Source code can be found
  [here]({{ great_cipher.py }}). The flag will not be in actf{} format and will
  just be the key, hex-enocded. The server is running at
  `web.angstromctf.com:1346`.
hint: All S-boxes are equal, but some are more equal than others.
