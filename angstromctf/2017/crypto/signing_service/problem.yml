title: Signing Service
value: 90
text: |
  We have found a server running that just signs whatever you send it. We also
  found a [file]({{ flag.txt }}) that was encrypted using the same key as the
  signing server uses. The key can be found [here]({{ pubkey.pem }}), the
  server can be found [here]({{ oracle.py }}), and the server can be found at
  `web.angstromctf.com:1347`.
hint: Perhaps it is not a great idea to just sign whatever people send you.
