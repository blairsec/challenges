title: Substitution Cipher
value: 60

  We have discovered [some ciphertext]({{ ciphertext.txt }}). We need you to
  find the plaintext. **The flag is in the {flag} format**, not the actf{flag}
  format. There are no spaces in flag.
hint: |
  The letters seem to be the only thing that was encrypted...how unfortunate.
flag: '{fewgoodmenjessep}'
