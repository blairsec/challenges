title: Very ez cipher
value: 180
text: |
  My friend Noah decided to build a cipher that would be unbreakable. Since he
  does not feel like trying very hard he made it a feistel network with a lot
  of rounds. Please retrieve the key used. An encryption service is running at
  `web.angstromctf.com:1350`. Code can be found [here]({{ feistel.py }}).
hint: Too bad there are so many rounds
