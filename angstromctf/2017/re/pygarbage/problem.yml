  Someone, namely me, thought it would be funny to obfuscate an encryption
  program before giving it to you. Here is the [program]({{ obfuscated.py }})
  and here is the [encrypted flag]({{ flag.txt }}). You're welcome.
hint: I wonder what opy stands for?
flag: actf{i_<3_python}
files:
  - obfuscated.py
  - flag.txt
